**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I use JUnit testing to ensure that all aspects of code functions as I expect to function. I also try to include secure two-factor authorizations when the program or clients requests a more secure interface.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Firstly I try and make sure that I get as much details from my client as possible so that I can be sure that I am building them the program that they requested. Second, I try and think to myself how I would feeli using their program and what changes I would make that would make the user experience better and more friendly.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I always try and approach designing software from a "want and need" perspective. The "want" is just that what I want the software to do or accomplish once it is complete. The "need" is what I will need to do in order to accomplish that want. I continue that process until I have established all of what I want the program to do and what I need to implement to improve it.
